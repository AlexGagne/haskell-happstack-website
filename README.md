# haskell-happstack-website
This website is my attempt at creating a website and server in Haskell on Heroku. It uses @begriffs's Haskell buildpack and is largely inspired by https://github.com/tel/happstack-heroku-test

I plan for this website to become my own personal website but is it currently incomplete.
